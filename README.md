The Dungeon Generator

This application randomly generates a series of connected chambers for the game Dungeons and Dragons. Each generated dungeon contains five randomly generated chambers. Each chamber has a random number of exits, traps inside, a monster, and treasure. 
These 5 chambers are now nodes for a graph. The algorithm then connects them all with passage ways. These passages are also populated with doors, monsters, and traps.

This program is run using Apache Ant. 
Tests are run through JUnit.
